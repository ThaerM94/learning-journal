# Syntax
The **color** data type is specified using one of the options listed below

# Color keywords
Color keywords are case-insensitive identifiers that represent a specific color, such as **red**, **blue**, **black**, or lightseagreen. Although the names more or less describes their respective colors, they are essentially artificial, without a strict rationale behind the names used.

# There are a few caveats to consider when using color keywords:

**HTML** only recognizes the 16 basic color keywords found in CSS1, using a specific algorithm to convert unrecognized values (often to completely different colors). The other color keywords should only be used in CSS and SVG.
Unlike HTML, CSS will completely ignore unknown keywords.
The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors, without transparency.

# Several keywords are aliases for each other:
**aqua / cyan**
**fuchsia / magenta**
**darkgray / darkgrey**
**darkslategray / darkslategrey**
**dimgray / dimgrey**
**lightgray / lightgrey**
**lightslategray / lightslategrey**
**gray / grey**
**slategray / slategrey**
# Though many keywords have been adapted from X11, their RGB values may differ from the corresponding color on X11 systems since manufacturers sometimes tailor X11 colors to their specific hardware.
