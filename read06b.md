# Logic Gates

**The logic gates are the main structural part of a digital system.**
* Logic Gates are a block of hardware that produces signals of binary 1 or 0 when input logic requirements are satisfied.
* Each gate has a distinct graphic symbol, and its operation can be described by means of algebraic expressions.
* The seven basic logic gates includes: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.
* The relationship between the input-output binary variables for each gate can be represented in tabular form by a truth table.
* Each gate has one or two binary input variables designated by A and B and one binary output variable designated by x.

1. **AND GATE**
2. **OR GATE**
3. **NOT GATE**
4. **NAND GATE**
5. **NOR GATE**
6. **Exclusive-OR/ XOR GATE**
7. **EXCLUSIVE-NOR/Equivalence GATE**
