# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

* The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

* Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run,In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

* JavaScript is primarily a scripting language for use within HTML pages, while Java is a real programming language that does quite different things from JavaScript.

* JavaScript is a client-side scripting language developed by **'*Brendan Eich.*'**
* JavaScript can be run on any operating systems and almost all web browsers.
* You need a text editor to write JavaScript code and a browser to display your web page.
