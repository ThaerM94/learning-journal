# Loops in Java

* In programming languages, loops are used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when some conditions become true. There are three types of loops in java.

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop

# For loop :
the java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times . if the number of iteration is fixed , it is recommended use for loop .

# While loop :
the java while loop is used to iterate a part of origram several times . if the number of iteration is not fixed , it is recommended to use while loop .

# Do-while loop : 
The java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times . use it if the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to excute the loop at last once.
